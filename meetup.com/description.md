Come and join us for the Open Mozilla Night. This meetup focuses on getting you
started for your first contribution to any Mozilla project and gives you a space
to continue your contributions among other Mozillians.

You can contribute in a variety of ways:

* Firefox development
* WebExtenions
* Servo
* Rust
* any Mozilla project
* translation
* MDN
* policy and advocacy

Join us if you want help to get started, continue to work on a Mozilla project or just
have a chat with community members.
